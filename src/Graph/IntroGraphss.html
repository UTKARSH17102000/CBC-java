<h4>
   Graph - Data Structrue <br>
   Components - Nodes/Vertex and Edge(Connects Two Nodes)<br>
   Types - Undirected Graphs(Edges are not  Directed in a particular Direction) & Directed Graphs(Directed Edges)<br>
   Degree -No. of edges which incoming and ongoing<br>
    Property of degree in Undirected graphs -  <h2>Total degree of all the nodes is twice of all edges </h2><br>
    Directeg Graphs - Two types of degree Indegree(Edges coming to the Node) and Outdegree(Edges going out of the node)<br>
    Path(Undirected) - Sequence of nodes such that no node visited twice<br>
    Path(Directed) - Same as undirected just moves in a particular directions of edges<br>
    Cyclic - It Means if u are standing on a particular node u can reach back to that node using somo different path .<br>
    Acylic - No cycle present in the graph .<br>
    DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph<br>
    Weights - value of an edge between two nodes .<br>
